Accordingly, reject OR fail to reject the  null based on the comparison between $Z_{score}$ and $Z_{\\alpha}$. We determine whether or not the $Z_{score}$ lies in the \"rejection region\" in the distribution. In other words, a \"rejection region\" is an interval where the null hypothesis is rejected iff the $Z_{score}$ lies in that region.\n",

However, other variables in regards to users may exist and affect the outcome, resulting in rejecting our null hypothesis. Nonetheless, it is strongly suggested, based on the results of this analysis, that the new landing page should not be implemented. Furhter studies should be in place to find a different approach to increase the conversion rate. Other approaches may include enhancing the purchasing process, tracking user interactions, and adding live chat capabilities.**"
